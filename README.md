# note_keeper

My Note-Keeper app includes the Drop Down List in which we have to select the priority i.e. High or Low for the particular note, after that we have to add the title of the note and then we have to add the description for that particular note the we have to click on the save button to save the note. After the note is saved we can even edit or delete that particular note.
